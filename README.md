# A Basic Neural Net

Mostly a repo for my reference, but still feel free to look at it. 

A basic neural net I implemented on my own without use of TensorFlow, Caffe, etc. Mostly useful to build out for reinforcing concepts. Nothing terribly fancy about it, but still cool.

You can see the output in the notebook file.
